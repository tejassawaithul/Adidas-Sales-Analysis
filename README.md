### Adidas Sales Analysis

âœ¨ **Excited to share my latest project, where I analyzed Adidas' sales data using Power BI to uncover valuable insights and create impactful visualizations!**

ðŸ“Š **Key Visuals**:
- Total Sales, Units Sold, and Operational Margin
- Sales trends by Year, Quarter, and Month
- Sales by Retailers, Regions, and Top Cities
- Product & Sales Method Performance

This analysis was aimed at providing Adidas with a clearer understanding of their sales performance across various dimensions. By using Power BI, I was able to visualize complex data, uncover key trends, and generate actionable insights or optimize its operations and drive strategic growth. The project covered important areas such as regional performance, top-performing products, and sales trends over time, which are crucial for informed decision-making and future planning.
